			VersatilePB Guest

This guest has ARM9 (Single Core ARMv5) CPU and various peripherals
expected on a VersatileAB (i.e. Application Base) Board.

We also have memory mapped VirtIO devices located at unused IO regions 
of the guest for providing VirtIO based paravirtualization.

There are many reserved IO regions as per VersatilePB and VersatileAB
User Guides. From these reserved IO regions, we will use the following 
IO regions for VirtIO:
0x14000000â€“0x1FFFFFFF (192M) (Reserved for Logic Tile Expansion)

The VirtIO devices also require a IRQ line per device for functioning. The
