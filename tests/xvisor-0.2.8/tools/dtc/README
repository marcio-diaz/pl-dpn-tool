This directory contains the source tree of the "Device tree Compiler" used
for Xvisor development.

This is a copy of the "Device tree compiler" directory of the linux 3.x
source tree.

In the linux source tree the "Device tree compiler" directory is at 
scripts/dtc.

Anytime you want to upgrade the Xvisor DTC compiler you should replace
all files in this directory with the latest from the linux source tree.

You should preserve only 2 files:
* The Makefile
* This README
