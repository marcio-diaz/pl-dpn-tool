config CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBOARD
	bool "Keyboard Driver Support"
	depends on CONFIG_INPUT
	default n
	help
		This option enables keyboard drivers

config CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD
	tristate "AT Keyboard"
	depends on CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBOARD
	default n
	select CONFIG_SERIO
	select CONFIG_SERIO_LIBPS2
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use a standard AT or PS/2 keyboard. Usually
	  you'll need this, unless you have a different type keyboard (USB, ADB
	  or other). This also works for AT and PS/2 keyboards connected over a
	  PS/2 to serial converter.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD_HP_KEYCODES
	bool "Use HP keyboard scancodes"
	default n
	depends on CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a PA-RISC machine and want to use an AT or
	  PS/2 keyboard, and your keyboard uses keycodes that are specific to
	  PA-RISC keyboards.

	  Say N if you use a standard keyboard.

config CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD_RDI_KEYCODES
	bool "Use PrecisionBook keyboard scancodes"
	default n
	depends on CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD_HP_KEYCODES
	help
	  If you have an RDI PrecisionBook, say Y here if you want to use its
	  built-in keyboard (as opposed to an external keyboard).

	  The PrecisionBook has five keys that conflict with those used by most
	  AT and PS/2 keyboards. These are as follows:

	    PrecisionBook    Standard AT or PS/2

	    F1               F12
	    Left Ctrl        Left Alt
	    Caps Lock        Left Ctrl
	    Right Ctrl       Caps Lock
	    Left             102nd key (the key to the right of Left Shift)

	  If you say N here, and use the PrecisionBook keyboard, then each key
	  in the left-hand column will be interpreted as the corresponding key
	  in the right-hand column.

	  If you say Y here, and use an external keyboard, then each key in the
	  right-hand column will be interpreted as the key shown in the
	  left-hand column.
