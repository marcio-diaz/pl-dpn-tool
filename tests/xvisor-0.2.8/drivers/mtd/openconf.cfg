          Memory Technology Devices are flash, RAM and similar chips, often
          used for solid state file systems on embedded devices. This option
          will provide the generic support for MTD drivers to register
          themselves with the kernel and for potential users of MTD devices
          to enumerate the devices which are present and obtain a handle on
          them. It will also allow you to select individual drivers for
          particular hardware and users of MTD devices. If unsure, say N.
