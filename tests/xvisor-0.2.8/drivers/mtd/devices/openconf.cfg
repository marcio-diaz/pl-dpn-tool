          This enables access to most modern SPI flash chips, used for
          program and data storage.   Series supported include Atmel AT26DF,
          Spansion S25SL, SST 25VF, ST M25P, and Winbond W25X.  Other chips
          are supported as well.  See the driver source for the current list,
          or to add other chips.

          Note that the original DataFlash chips (AT45 series, not AT26DF),
          need an entirely different driver.

          Set up your spi devices with the right board-specific platform data,
          if you want to specify device partitioning or to use a device which
          doesn't support the JEDEC ID instruction.
