	  I2C (pronounce: I-squared-C) is a slow serial bus protocol used in
	  many micro controller applications and developed by Philips.  SMBus,
	  or System Management Bus is a subset of the I2C protocol.  More
	  information is contained in the directory <file:Documentation/i2c/>,
	  especially in the file called "summary" there.

	  Both I2C and SMBus are supported here. You will need this for
	  hardware sensors support, and also for Video For Linux support.

	  If you want I2C support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your bus adapter(s) below.

	  This I2C support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-core.
