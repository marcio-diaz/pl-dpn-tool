config CONFIG_FB
	tristate "Frame Buffer Framework"
	default n
	help
	  Enable frame buffer support for Xvisor.

config CONFIG_FB_CFB_FILLRECT
	bool
	depends on CONFIG_FB
	default n
	---help---
	  Include the cfb_fillrect function for generic software rectangle
	  filling. This is used by drivers that don't provide their own
	  (accelerated) version.

config CONFIG_FB_CFB_COPYAREA
	bool
	depends on CONFIG_FB
	default n
	---help---
	  Include the cfb_copyarea function for generic software area copying.
	  This is used by drivers that don't provide their own (accelerated)
	  version.

config CONFIG_FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT
	bool
	depends on CONFIG_FB
	default n
	---help---
	  Include the cfb_imageblit function for generic software image
	  blitting. This is used by drivers that don't provide their own
	  (accelerated) version.

config CONFIG_FB_CFB_REV_PIXELS_IN_BYTE
	bool
	depends on CONFIG_FB
	default n
	---help---
	  Allow generic frame-buffer functions to work on displays with 1, 2
	  and 4 bits per pixel depths which has opposite order of pixels in
	  byte order to bytes in long order.

config CONFIG_FB_SYS_FILLRECT
	bool
	depends on CONFIG_FB
	default n
	---help---
	  Include the sys_fillrect function for generic software rectangle
	  filling. This is used by drivers that don't provide their own
	  (accelerated) version and the framebuffer is in system RAM.

config CONFIG_FB_SYS_COPYAREA
	bool
	depends on CONFIG_FB
	default n
	---help---
	  Include the sys_copyarea function for generic software area copying.
	  This is used by drivers that don't provide their own (accelerated)
	  version and the framebuffer is in system RAM.

config CONFIG_FB_SYS_IMAGEBLIT
	bool
	depends on CONFIG_FB
	default n
	---help---
	  Include the sys_imageblit function for generic software image
	  blitting. This is used by drivers that don't provide their own
	  (accelerated) version and the framebuffer is in system RAM.

menuconfig CONFIG_FB_FOREIGN_ENDIAN
	bool "Framebuffer foreign endianness support"
	depends on CONFIG_FB
	---help---
	  This menu will let you enable support for the framebuffers with
	  non-native endianness (e.g. Little-Endian framebuffer on a
	  Big-Endian machine). Most probably you don't have such hardware,
	  so it's safe to say "n" here.

choice
	prompt "Choice endianness support"
	depends on CONFIG_FB_FOREIGN_ENDIAN

config CONFIG_FB_BOTH_ENDIAN
	bool "Support for Big- and Little-Endian framebuffers"

config CONFIG_FB_BIG_ENDIAN
	bool "Support for Big-Endian framebuffers only"

config CONFIG_FB_LITTLE_ENDIAN
	bool "Support for Little-Endian framebuffers only"

endchoice

config CONFIG_FB_MODE_HELPERS
        bool "Enable Video Mode Handling Helpers"
        depends on CONFIG_FB
	default n
	---help---
	  This enables functions for handling video modes using the
	  Generalized Timing Formula and the EDID parser. A few drivers rely
          on this feature such as the radeonfb, rivafb, and the i810fb. If
	  your driver does not take advantage of this feature, choosing Y will
	  just increase the kernel size by about 5K.

config CONFIG_FB_TILEBLITTING
       bool "Enable Tile Blitting Support"
       depends on CONFIG_FB
       default n
       ---help---
         This enables tile blitting.  Tile blitting is a drawing technique
	 where the screen is divided into rectangular sections (tiles), whereas
	 the standard blitting divides the screen into pixels. Because the
	 default drawing element is a tile, drawing functions will be passed
	 parameters in terms of number of tiles instead of number of pixels.
	 For example, to draw a single character, instead of using bitmaps,
	 an index to an array of bitmaps will be used.  To clear or move a
	 rectangular section of a screen, the rectangle will be described in
	 terms of number of tiles in the x- and y-axis.

	 This is particularly important to one driver, matroxfb.  If
	 unsure, say N.

config CONFIG_FB_ARMCLCD
	tristate "ARM PrimeCell PL110 support"
	depends on CONFIG_FB && CONFIG_ARM
	select CONFIG_FB_CFB_FILLRECT
	select CONFIG_FB_CFB_COPYAREA
	select CONFIG_FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT
	default n
	help
	  This framebuffer device driver is for the ARM PrimeCell PL110
	  Colour LCD controller.  ARM PrimeCells provide the building
	  blocks for System on a Chip devices.

config CONFIG_FB_VESA
	bool "VESA VGA graphics support"
	depends on (CONFIG_FB = y) && CONFIG_X86
	select CONFIG_FB_CFB_FILLRECT
	select CONFIG_FB_CFB_COPYAREA
	select CONFIG_FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT
	help
	  This is the frame buffer device driver for generic VESA 2.0
	  compliant graphic cards. The older VESA 1.2 cards are not supported.
	  You will get a boot time penguin logo at no additional cost. 
	  If unsure, say Y.
