	default y
	help
		This option forces ARM compiler to use frame pointer for
		all functions hence making stack tracing possible.

		Enabling this option forces compiler to add additional 
		instructions to setup stack frame in function prolog of 
		all functions. 

		Disabling this option makes hypervisor slightly faster but
		disable stack trace information printed by hypervisor. 

		By default, this options is always enabled. You can disable 
		this option in-case you want slightly faster and slight 
		smaller hypervisor

config CONFIG_ARM_ERRATA_773022
	bool "ARM errata: incorrect instructions may be executed from loop buffer"
	depends on CONFIG_ARMV7A_VE
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 773022 Cortex-A15
	  (up to r0p4) erratum. In certain rare sequences of code, the
	  loop buffer may deliver incorrect instructions. This
	  workaround disables the loop buffer to avoid the erratum.
