	(Last Commit: 375b8c569071cb8bf543af8b52477e0480f93100)
		(Release Date: 14-Nov-2015)

In this release, we have lot of new features, drivers, emulators,
and improvements.

New Features:
 - Simple light-weight serial port driver framework
 - Boot-time initrd block device creation from device tree
 - Support multiple banks of host RAM
 - More Linux-like DMA mapping APIs
 - Linux compatible NAPI APIs
 - Logical SMP IDs for host CPUs based their boot-order
 - Support for marking a host IRQ as inter-processor interrupt
 - Generic exceptions table APIs
 - Separate per-CPU irq handler for per-CPU host IRQs
 - Generic PA->VA mappings API using rbtree based hash
 - Memory read/write relaxed legacy APIs
 - Linux-like vmm_host_irqdomain APIs which handles both static
   and extended host IRQs
 - Priority-based rate monotonic scheduling algorithm
 - Support for async-IPI based wakeup from wait-for-interrupt
 - Allow guest regions to be added from emulator probe
 - Emulated irqchip construct (i.e. vmm_devemu_irqchip) in
   device emulation framework

New Commands:
 - mii command similar to Linux mii-tool
 - sleep command similar to bash's sleep command
 - echo command similar to bash's echo command
 - set_affinity sub-command for host irq command
 - module_load sub-command for vfs command

New Drivers:
 - Micrel PHY driver
 - i.MX6 FEC ethernet driver
 - BCM2836 local INTC irqchip driver
 - i.mx25 clock driver
 - i.MX25 pin control driver

New Emulators:
 - Generic PCIe host controller emulator (EXPERIEMENTAL)
 - Simple pass-through emulator

ARM Ports:
 -  Use vmm_host_irq_find() to find appropriate IPI for
    architecture specific IPI callbacks

ARM32ve Port:
 - Lazy context switching of VFP/ASIMD registers
 - Force disable coprocessor and system traps in VCPU init
 - Raspberry Pi2 (BCM2836 SOC) board support

ARM64 Port:
 - Force disable coprocessor and system traps in VCPU init
 - Added invalidate_dcache_mva() and invalidate_dcache_mva_range()

x86 Port:
 - Fix for a crash on multi-IOAPIC system.
 - A lot in port of Intel VMX (currently in nascent state).
 - Support for passing initrd to xvisor as root FS.
 - Arch implementation of memcpy.
 - Default console now can be overridden with console bootrags
 - Boot time script for mounting root.
 - Wait for block device settling.
 - Tested boot on Intel and AMD based desk/laptops.
