	(Last Commit: d8873e0af7a4352b5bd88855e08f623959a73109)
		(Release Date: 28-Feb-2012)

In this release, we added few features, cleaned-up our code, and formalized 
our coding-style document.

New Features:
 - Wait-for-interrupt support in VCPU irq subsystem
 - Dynamic guest creation/destruction
 - Device clock managment support in device driver framework
 - RTC device framework
 - Wall-clock subsystem for tracking real-time
 - PL031 RTC emulators

ARM 32-bit Port:
 - Replaced wfi instruction with a new hypercall. The new hypercall uses 
   wait-for-interrupt feature of VCPU irq subsystem.
 - Added support for VCPU deinit required for destroying a VCPU
 - Linux guest is able to sync date/time from emulated RTC
 - Added support for emulating cache operations
 - Xvisor ARM running on BeagleBoard-xM is able to boot Linux kernel on
   Realview-PB-A8 guest

MIPS 32-bit Port:
 - Xvisor MIPS boots up and gets to managment terminal.
 - Guest support in Xvisor MIPS is still work-in-progress.

x86 64-bit Port:
 - Initial compilable code for supporting Intel x86_64
