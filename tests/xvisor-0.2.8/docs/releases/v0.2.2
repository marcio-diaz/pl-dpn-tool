In this release, we have new features, drivers, emulators and 
board supports.

New Features:
 - Generic LIFO & FIFO APIs under libs/common
 - VirtIO based paravirtualization
 - Lazy port-to-switch transfers in network switch
 - Lookup based clock device (clkdev) framework
 - Light-weight MMC/SD/SDIO framework
 - Block device partitioning
 - Faster Orphan VCPU preemption using arch_vcpu_preempt_orphan()
 - Boot time or early parameters to hypervisor

New Drivers:
 - IMX serial port driver
 - PL180 MMCI driver
 - Generic SDHCI driver
 - BCM2835 SDHCI driver
 - I8042 keyboard and mouse controller driver

New Emulators:
 - VirtIO MMIO transport emulator
 - VirtIO Network device emulator
 - VirtIO Block device emulator
 - VirtIO Console device emulator
 - ARM11MPCore emulator

MIPS 32-bit Port:
 - The MIPS port is orphaned since long time and currently broken
 - From this release, we remove MIPS port and hope that someone
   will fix and add it back later

ARM 32-bit Port:
 - Added support for ARMv6 CPUs
 - Added support for Realview-EB-MPCore
 - Added support for Raspberry Pi (BCM2835 SOC)
 - Added support for KZM (i.MX31 SOC)
 - Added support for 3DS (i.MX25 SOC)
 - Added Realview-EB-MPCore guest for ARMv6 host
 - Added CPU specific quirks and errata implementations
 - Fixed cache operations for ARMv5, ARMv6 and ARMv7 CPUs
 - Implemented arch_vcpu_preempt_orphan() for Orphan VCPUs
 - Added support for external DTB provided by bootloaders

ARM 32-bit with VE Port:
 - Added stubs and macros for adding VGIC assisted GIC emulation
 - Implemented arch_vcpu_preempt_orphan() for Orphan VCPUs
 - Added support for external DTB provided by bootloaders

x86_64 Port:
 - Fixed context switching
 - Fixed HPET timer
 - Fixed IOAPIC driver
 - Populate device tree from ACPI tables
 - Got Xvisor x86_64 prompt working on QEMU using AT-keyboard 
   and text mode framebuffer
