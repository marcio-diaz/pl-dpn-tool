		Xvisor Version Scheme

The Xvisor Version Scheme is intended to capture the progress of Xvisor 
in-terms of feature additions. 

The Xvisor Version Scheme is as follow:

 1. We use 3 numbers major, minor, and release for version numbers. 
    We write this in following format: 
               <major> . <minor> . <release>
 2. We will increase <release> number after 5+ feature additions. 
    The addition of new port, driver, emulator, library, command, and daemons 
    will also be considered as new feature.
 3. There is no limit on <release> number, it will keep increasing.
    The <release> number will be reset 0 only when we increment <minor> number.
 4. We will increase <minor> number on reaching a milestone. Examples of
    milestones could be First release, SMP support, Network support, etc.
 5. There is no limit on <minor> number, it will keep increasing.
    The <minor> number will be reset 0 only when we increment <major> number.
 6. Increasing <major> number will be based on discussions on xvisor-devel 
    mailing list.

In the above, point 2 is based on our current pace of development. 
In future, we will keep adapting point 2 based on pace of development at that 
time such that <release> number will increase at a steady rate.
